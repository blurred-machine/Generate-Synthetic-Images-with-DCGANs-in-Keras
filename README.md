# Generate-Synthetic-Images-with-DCGANs-in-Keras
In this project, I have built a DCGAN based synthetic image generator and a discriminator on the fashion-MNIST dataset. Generated synthetic images using DCGAN and tried to fool the discriminator


## Implementation:
- DCGAN based genetated imges over 12 epocs
